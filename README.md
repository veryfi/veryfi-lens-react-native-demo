- In order to be able to enable iOS Lens native localization you need to enable a supported language on the project file:
![Step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryfi/veryfi-lens-react-native-demo/main/github_assets/localization-step1.png)

- Generate  localization files for the desired language (for example in storyboard):
![Step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veryfi/veryfi-lens-react-native-demo/main/github_assets/localization-step2.png)
